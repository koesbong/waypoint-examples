This example shows how to deploy an application built with buildpacks
to Kubernetes using templated Kubernetes YAML files. This would also work
with JSON or Jsonnet files.

The `kubernetes-apply` plugin is expected to be released via the 0.4.0 release.
It is currently available through the `main` branch on waypoint.
